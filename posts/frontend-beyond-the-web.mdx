Frontend is often associated with web development, but it extends far beyond that realm. In a world dominated by web and mobile applications, it's easy to overlook the wide variety of other frontend technologies that are shaping the way we interact with software. In this blog post, we'll delve into the world of frontend development outside of web development, exploring the technologies used, the companies hiring for these skills, and the valuable software created without a web frontend layer.

### **Desktop Application Development**

Languages and frameworks like C++, C#, Java, and Python, along with GUI libraries such as Qt, GTK+, and WPF, are commonly used to develop desktop applications with rich user interfaces.

### **Mobile Application Development**

> For native mobile app development, developers often use languages like Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android, along with platform-specific SDKs (Software Development Kits) provided by Apple and Google.

### **Game Development**

Frontend game development typically involves the use of game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, or Godot. These engines provide tools and frameworks to create engaging, interactive user experiences.

### **Embedded Systems and IoT Devices**

For frontend development on embedded systems and IoT devices, languages like C, C++, and Rust are popular choices, along with specific libraries and frameworks designed for the hardware in question.

Various industries and companies seek talented frontend developers for non-web projects. Software companies like Adobe and Microsoft, game studios such as Electronic Arts and Ubisoft, and hardware manufacturers like Apple and Samsung hire frontend developers to create visually appealing and engaging user interfaces for desktop applications, mobile apps, video games, and embedded systems. Examples of valuable software without web frontend layers include Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office Suite, popular mobile apps like Instagram, and video games like Red Dead Redemption 2. Furthermore, smart home devices such as Amazon Echo and Apple HomePod also feature user interfaces designed specifically for their hardware.
